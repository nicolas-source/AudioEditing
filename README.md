### Audio Editing via Python's pydub library

Given a Intro.mp3 file and a PodcastClip.mp3 file, 
the program can stitch the intro file at the 
front or back or inbetween the podcastclip file with crossfade effects


Note: When playing clips start from low volume

Note: The program takes about 5-10s to complete
